**Question:**

Java Program to Check Whether a Number is Positive or Negative

When you run the program, the output will be:
```
12.3 is a positive number.
```
If you change the value of number to a negative `number` (say -12.3), the output will be:
```
-12.3 is a negative number.
```
In the above program, it is quite clear how variable `number` is checked to be positive or negative, by comparing it to 0.

If you're not sure, here is the breakdown:
If a number is greater than zero, it is a positive number.
If a number is less than zero, it is a negative number.
If a number equals to zero, it is zero.
